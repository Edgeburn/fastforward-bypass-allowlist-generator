# FastForward Bypass Allowlist Generator

This is a script to generate an ABP allowlist for the [FastForward](https://fastforward.team) extension from their list of bypasses found [here](https://github.com/FastForwardTeam/FastForward/blob/manifest-v3/Bypassed.md). This list can be used in a browser-based adblocking extension such as uBlock Origin to prevent the alerts warning you of a filtered site being shown. You can also add this list to something like Pi-hole or AdGuard Home to allow the bypassed sites to be accessed.

You can use the list generated by this script in the latest workflow run [here](https://github.com/Edgeburn/fastforward-bypass-allowlist-generator/actions/workflows/generate.yml) in the artifacts section, add `https://edgeburnmedia.com/fastforward/adblock-rules.txt` to your adblocker (which is automatically updated every month), or generate your own list by following the instructions below.

## Generating your own list

### Requirements

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system. The automated workflow uses Node.js v18, so I recommend using that version.

### Generating the list

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies (There are none at the moment, but this may be needed in the future)
3. Run `npm run generate` to generate the list
4. The list will be generated in the `adblock-rules.txt` file
5. Add the entries of the list to your adblocker in whatever way is appropriate
